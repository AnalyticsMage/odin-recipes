        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            
            <li>
                <strong>Optional Soaking</strong>: If soaking rice, rinse, drain, and add to a mixing bowl. Cover with cool water and soak for 12 hours or overnight. For a quicker soak, cover in hot water for 1 hour. Then rinse and drain.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cook the Rice</strong>: Add cooking water to a medium saucepan (1 ¼ cups if you soaked the rice), along with rinsed rice and a pinch of salt. Heat over high until boiling, then reduce heat to simmer and cover. Cook for 15-20 minutes, or until water is absorbed and rice is tender. If using unsoaked rice, it may take up to 30 minutes. Keep covered and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare Gochujang Sauce</strong>: If making homemade, prepare now. Skip this step if using store-bought sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sauté the Vegetables</strong>: While the rice is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add 1 tsp of sesame oil to coat the pan. 
                <ul>
                    <li>Add vegetables one at a time and cook in batches (1-2 minutes each) until lightly browned.</li>
                    <li>Season each batch with minced garlic and a dash of coconut aminos, tamari, or sea salt.</li>
                    <li>Cook zucchini first, then carrots, green onion, bean sprouts, and spinach.</li>
                    <li>Arrange cooked vegetables on a serving plate in separate piles and cover to keep warm.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cook the Eggs</strong> (if using): In the same pan, heat a little more sesame oil over medium heat. Crack the eggs into the pan. For sunny-side up, cover with a lid briefly to steam for 1 minute, then remove the lid and cook until the whites are set and yolks are still runny. Turn off heat and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Assemble the Bibimbap</strong>: Divide the cooked rice into serving bowls. Top with portions of the sautéed vegetables and an egg. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Serve</strong>: Add 1-2 tablespoons of Gochujang sauce and optional toppings like kimchi and sesame seeds. Mix everything together with chopsticks or a spoon and enjoy!
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Storage</strong>: Bibimbap is best enjoyed fresh. Leftovers can be stored in the fridge for up to 2 days and reheated as a stir-fry. It is not freezer-friendly.
