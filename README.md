# odin-recipes
Simple recipes project as a part of Odin Project

While doing this project, I lerned the basics of HTML structure through hands-on practice. I created a simple recipe website with an index page linking to individual recipe pages. The project tought me how to structure an HTML document, add headings, images, links, lists, to name a few. Additionally, I gained further practice in version control with Git and GitHub, learned how to organize and publish my work online.

**Notes for my future self:** Project was rather quick to do, hence did not add/commit while doing. Not a good practice. Keep that in mind in the future projects and add and commit often.
